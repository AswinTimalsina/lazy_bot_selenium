# lazy_bot_selenium

An automated bot created to collect links of pdf from ULM Library.

Inspiration:
- I was given the task to provide the links of pdf from the search result of certain keywords.
- I had to do not just one search, there were 25-30 topics I had to search on.
- I am lazy so created this bot using selenium to create a text file with links of pdf.
- Took me around an hour to do research and write the code
- I would have wasted around 2-3 hours easily to do manual task :D (I would not learn anything out of this)
